- Establish progress and performance measurements at every stage of the data flow. Where possible, benchmark data-flow cycle times.
- Define rules for an abstracted semantic layer. Ensure everyone is “speaking the same language” and agrees upon what the data (and metadata) is and is not.
- Validate with the “eyeball test”: Include continuous-improvement -oriented human feedback loops. Consumers must be able to trust the data, and that can only come with incremental validation.
- Automate as many stages of the data flow as possible including BI, data science, and analytics.
- Using benchmarked performance information, identify bottlenecks and then optimize for them. This may require investment in commodity hardware, or automation of a formerly-human-delivered data-science step in the process.
- Establish governance discipline, with a particular focus on two-way data control, data ownership, transparency, and comprehensive data lineage tracking through the entire workflow.`
